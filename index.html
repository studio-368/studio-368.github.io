    <h4>ABOUT</h4>
    <p class="center"> Traveler’s Notebook: Monster Tales is a two-player narrative-driven game where
        players are authors who are traveling the world, encountering monsters from various cultures, in order to get
        inspiration for their stories. When it is a player’s turn, they select a location and choose how they want to
        react to the monster with which they have come face-to-face. The other player then reads to them the tale of
        their encounter and they are able to choose whether they would like to exercise one of their skills. Through
        these encounters, players can gain additional skills, as well as inspiration points.The first player to 100
        inspiration points wins!
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        We recommend at least a 4th grade reading level.
